# KAMP
317 project
The final product is under the KGame file.

We have had issues with the game working on certain computers. The game works perfectly on some comupters, and I believe that the error has to do with the audio player external libraries that we used. If for any reason you cannot run the program, please contact us as it works on our computers.
